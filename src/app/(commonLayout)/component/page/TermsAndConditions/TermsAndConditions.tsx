                  Banksia is not a letting agent and should not be regarded as
                  one. We operate as a corporate landlord, leasing properties
                  directly from head freeholders and head leaseholders for the
                  purpose of offering high-quality serviced accommodation.
                  Banksia does not issue Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST)
                  agreements. Instead, all guests are provided accommodation
                  under Short-Term Licence Agreements or Licences to Occupy.
                  These agreements do not grant exclusive possession of any
                  unit, as our in-house housekeeping, linen, and maintenance
                  teams require regular access to the premises to uphold our
                  service standards. This structure ensures compliance,
                  operational efficiency, and a consistently high-quality guest
                  experience.
